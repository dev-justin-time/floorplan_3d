/**
 * Advanced feature 19 - one snapping entry point.
 *
 * The editor grew three snapping implementations (grid rounding in
 * scene-drag, wall-face fitting in wall-snap, run/vertical fitting in
 * elevation-snap). They stay where they are, but every caller now goes through
 * this module, which fixes the priority order in one place:
 *
 *   1. grid        coarse placement
 *   2. wall face   flush against a wall (overrides the grid)
 *   3. run         butt joints along a wall run (elevation views)
 *   4. vertical    stacking / floor (elevation views)
 *
 * `resolveSnap` is the plan-space pipeline (1 -> 2); `runSnap` and
 * `verticalSnap` are the elevation-space pipeline (3 -> 4), re-exported here so
 * both views quote the same rules.
