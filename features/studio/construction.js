 * storey carry the joists of the floor above, so the floor-to-floor pitch is
 * wall + joist. The top storey uses the same 8 in band as a ceiling/joist space
 * and carries a truss roof above it.
 *
 * `story.height` stays the floor-to-floor pitch for older callers (stairs, the
 * project schema); `story.wallHeight` and `story.floorDepth` are the parts.
