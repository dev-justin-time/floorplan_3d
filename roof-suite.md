# Roof suite

A truss-roof design system: ten styles, a layered roof build-up (sheathing,
underlayment, shingle or tile covering), a rain-gutter package, a costed
takeoff and the code-style checks that tie them together. Open
`roof-designer.html` for the standalone workspace, or use the **Roof** panel in
`Editor.html` to dress the top storey.

## Pages

| File | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `roof-designer.html` | Designer workspace: styles, geometry, layers, gutters, elevation section, 3D preview, takeoff, checks, glossary and formulas. |
| `features/roof/styles.js` | The ten styles, their plane geometry, truss member lines, eave/ridge/hip runs. |
| `features/roof/materials.js` | Sheathing, underlayment, covering and gutter catalogue with coverage, slope window, weight, life and cost. |
| `features/roof/design.js` | `computeRoofDesign()` - quantities, costs, checks, CSV and summary; `ROOF_DEFAULTS`. |
| `features/roof/glossary.js` | 62 terms in six categories plus the formulas the engine applies. |
| `features/roof/preview.js` | Three.js viewer rebuilt from a design, and the 2D elevation section. |
| `features/studio/roof.js` | Builds the same roof in the editor: deck, covering, caps, vent, fascia, drip edge, gutters and downspouts. |

## The ten styles

| Key | Name | Truss | Planes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gable-king` | Gable · king post | King post | 2 |
| `gable-fink` | Gable · Fink | Fink (W-web) | 2 |
| `gable-howe` | Gable · Howe | Howe | 2 |
| `gable-scissor` | Gable · scissor | Scissor | 2 |
| `gable-attic` | Gable · attic | Raised tie | 2 |
| `gambrel` | Gambrel | Gambrel | 4 |
| `hip` | Hip | Hip | 4 |
| `cross-gable` | Cross gable | Cross | 4 |
| `shed` | Shed · mono-pitch | Shed | 1 |
| `saltbox` | Saltbox | Saltbox | 2 |

Geometry is generated in metres: `x` across the span, `z` along the ridge,
`y = 0` at the wall top. Overhangs lower the eave by `overhang × pitch / 12`.
Gable and saltbox ridges include the overhang; hip caps follow the slope, so
their length includes the fall from ridge to eave.

## Layers

1. **Deck** - OSB or plywood sheet count from roof area + waste (`2.9768 m²`
   per 1220 × 2440 sheet), with nail/clip allowance.
2. **Underlayment** - felt, synthetic or peel-and-stick; rolls from 92.9 m²
   coverage plus 5%, and a minimum slope per product.
3. **Ice and water shield** - eave length × `min(0.9 m, slope length)` in cold
   climates (and optional elsewhere), plus 18.6 m² rolls.
4. **Covering** - 3-tab, architectural, standing-seam metal, clay or concrete
   tile, slate, modified bitumen, 3-ply BUR, TPO/EPDM, roll roofing. Priced per
   square or per unit; bundles 3 per square for shingles, 100 tiles per square
   for clay (95 concrete, 220 slate).
5. **Starter strip and ridge/hip cap** - starter bundles for shingles; cap
   bundles (35 lf), tile pieces (0.45 m) or metal cap metres.
6. **Flashing** - drip edge (eave + rake), valley metal, step and apron
   flashing, counter flashing, kickouts, pipe boots, gutter apron and a chimney
   cricket.
7. **Ventilation** - ridge vent and soffit strip, with free area against the
   1:300 requirement.
8. **Rain gutter** - 5 in or 6 in K-style aluminium, 5 in half-round, 4 in box
   steel or 6 in copper; hangers at 500-600 mm, end caps, outlets, elbows and
   downspouts (auto: at least two, one per 12 m of run, and roof area divided by
   the profile's capacity).

## Checks

Every design returns `checks` with `severity` of `ok`, `info`, `warn` or
`error`:

- covering slope window (min/max), and low-slope below 2:12;
- ponding below 0.25:12;
- style minimum pitch;
- dead load (`kg/m²`) for tile, slate and BUR;
- tile at more than 406 mm truss spacing (error);
- ice dam protection in a cold climate;
- balanced intake/exhaust and 1:300 free vent area;
- downspout capacity per profile;
- underlayment slope minimum;
- valleys, chimney flashing, hail climate, deep overhangs and waste allowance;
- warranty conditions.

## Takeoff

`computeRoofDesign()` returns `areas` (roof, plan, squares, waste, ice shield,
vent), `layers` (sheets, rolls, covering units, caps, flashing lengths),
`structure` counts (`trussCount`, `ceilingJoists`, `trussLumberM`),
`gutterPackage`, `ventilation`, `costs` (material, labour, tear-off, gutter,
flashing, total, per square, per m², rows) and `summary`.

`roofTakeoffCsv(design)` writes the grouped bill plus a summary block;
`takeoffRows(design)` feeds the on-page table.

## Editor integration

`Editor.html` → sidebar **Roof** sets style, pitch, overhang, covering, gutter
profile, gutters and ridge vent, and summarises squares and estimate for the
top-storey footprint. The header **Roof** switch shows the result. Values travel
with the project (`roofConfig`) and restore with autosave.

**Send to editor** on the designer page stores `roof-editor-draft`; the editor
applies it after restoring the autosave, so the designed roof wins, switches the
roof on and rebuilds the 3D scene.

## Tests

```bash
node .check-roof.js     # 119 design, takeoff, glossary and builder checks
node .check-studio.js   # 86 studio checks, including the truss roof
node .check-stairs.js   # 185 stair checks
node .browser-check.mjs # 166 browser checks (server on :8766)
```

## Limits

Quantities are a metric design aid, not an engineered truss design or a quote.
Labour rates and material prices are illustrative; the truss member lines show
the family, not a sealed truss calculation. Roof windows, solar arrays and
parapets are described in the glossary but are not modelled.
